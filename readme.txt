Allows you to define areas of text that expand/collapse when clicked. It is an improved version of Dagon Design's Expanding Text-Plugin.

== Description ==

Website-elements which are collapsable help avoiding visual noise these days and give control to the user, what they want to see. Dagon Design developed a WordPress-Plugin called “<a href="http://www.dagondesign.com/articles/expanding-text-plugin-for-wordpress">Expanding Text</a>” which enables a blogger to make any part of a post collapsable. I wasn’t entirely convinced with it, so I forked my own plugin.

<h4>
    Improvements compared to Expanding Text
  </h4>
  
  <ul style="margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 30px;">
    <li style="margin: 0px;">
      You can freely choose a text to be shown in front of the expand-link (default is a double-arrow), which indicates whether the part is collapsed or expanded next
    </li>
    <li style="margin: 0px;">
      the expand-part will expand via a jQuery-animation. This looks a lot better, than having the text just appear all of the sudden.
    </li>
    <li style="margin: 0px;">
      You can add expanding text directly with a media-button in the article editor
    </li>
  </ul></span>
</h4></span>

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
