== Description ==

<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; color: #284984;"> <h4>
  <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal; line-height: 19px;">Website-elements which are collapsable help avoiding visual noise these days and give control to the user, what they want to see. Dagon Design developed a WordPress-Plugin called “<a href="http://www.dagondesign.com/articles/expanding-text-plugin-for-wordpress">Expanding Text</a>” which enables a blogger to make any part of a post collapsable. I wasn’t entirely convinced with it, so I forked my own plugin.</span>

    Improvements compared to Expanding Text

  <ul style="margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 30px;">
    <li style="margin: 0px;">
      A double-arrow is shown next to the expand-link, which indicates whether the part is collapsed or expanded next
    </li>
    <li style="margin: 0px;">
      the expand-part will expand via a jQuery-animation. This looks a lot better, than having the text just appear all of the sudden.
    </li>
  </ul></span>

== Installation ==
